this project made based on Udemy Chatbot Development in a Weekend (GPT, FastAPI, AWS) course, by Eric Roby.

The app has an interface of a form with a send button to send message. The AI-based response gives textual answer. Also, there is an option to generate a picture based on description.

There was an attempt to upload this to AWS Lambda. For some reason, it doesn't run.
